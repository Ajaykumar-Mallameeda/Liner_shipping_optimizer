## CRITICAL EXECUTION PIPELINE

```
Orchestrator
  └── RegionalAgent
        └── ServiceGeneratorAgent
              └── DeploymentOptimizer
                    ├── GA Solver
                    ├── MILP Solver
                    └── ProfitEvaluator
```

Always trace issues through this full chain. Never analyze a single file in isolation.

## KEY DIRECTORY MAP

| Directory       | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `agents/`       | Regional agents, service generator agents    |
| `optimization/` | Solvers (GA, MILP), deployment optimizer     |
| `data/`         | Data loaders, preprocessing pipelines        |
| `tests/`        | Unit and integration tests                   |
| `api/`          | External endpoints and interfaces            |

## KNOWN ARCHITECTURAL RISKS (update as confirmed)

- [ ] `DeploymentOptimizer` suspected to exceed 800 lines — check for SRP violation
- [ ] `data_loader` may lack try/except on file read — crash risk on missing files
- [ ] Distance calculations may be recomputed without caching — O(n²) risk
- [ ] Naming inconsistency suspected: `region` vs `area` across agents

> Move confirmed issues to `patterns.md` once verified in code.

## ANALYSIS DEFAULTS

- Health score baseline: start at 10.0, deduct per issue severity
  - CRITICAL: −1.5 each
  - HIGH: −0.7 each
  - MEDIUM: −0.3 each
  - LOW: −0.1 each
- Confidence level: state explicitly in every report
- Always provide both Minimal Fix and Optimal Fix

---

## USER PREFERENCES

- Output format: structured report (see agent prompt for template)
- Communication style: precise, no fluff, engineering-grade
- Fix preference: minimal change first, then optimal
- Memory: update after every session with confirmed patterns

## TOPIC FILES (detailed notes — link from here)

| File               | Contents                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `patterns.md`      | Confirmed code patterns and anti-patterns     |
| `debugging.md`     | Recurring bugs, root causes, fixes applied    |
| `architecture.md`  | Module structure, decisions, layer map        |
| `performance.md`   | Bottlenecks, caching wins, complexity fixes   |
| `testing-gaps.md`  | Missing tests identified across the project   |

## SESSION LOG (most recent first — agent appends here)

<!-- Agent: append a one-line summary after each session -->
<!-- Format: [YYYY-MM-DD] Brief description of what was analyzed and key finding -->
[2026-05-09] Complete end-to-end architectural audit: Found functional AI pipeline but broken real-time dashboard integration due to WebSocket mismatches and mock data usage
[2026-05-09] Identified critical frontend disconnect: maritime_dashboard.jsx uses hardcoded DATA, no WebSocket client implemented
[2026-05-09] Discovered event schema inconsistency: main.py validates events via EventValidator but real_orchestrator_integration.py sends raw dicts
